# Toadstool Trattoria & Bar

## About this project

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) to create a mock restaurant page almost entirely in Javascript. With the exception of the sitenav, this page utilizes as little HTML and global JS as possible.
